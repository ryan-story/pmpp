# Chapter 17

## Code

In this chapter we actually don't implement the underlaying reconstruction, what we do is we provide code to improve the understanding of the underlaying concept. We:

- Present an [FFT theory notebook](./code/fft.ipynb), explaining how it works.
- Present [code for opening an MRI image](./code/mri_reconstruction.ipynb) and conducting a reconstruction on top of it.
- Implement [code](./code/cg_algo.py) showing how the Conjugate Gradient (CG) works. 

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Loop fission splits a loop into two loops. Use the F H D code in Fig. 17.4 and enumerate the execution order of the two parts of the outer loop body: (1) the statements before the inner loop and (2) the inner loop.**

#### Original code

```cpp
01  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
02    rMu[m] = rPhi[m]*rD[m] + iPhi[m]*iD[m];
03    iMu[m] = rPhi[m]*iD[m] - iPhi[m]*rD[m];
04    for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
05      float expFhD = 2*PI*(kx[m]*x[n] + ky[m]*y[n] + kz[m]*z[n]);
06      float cArg = cos(expFhD);
07      float sArg = sin(expFhD);
08      rFhD[n] += rMu[m]*cArg - iMu[m]*sArg;
09      iFhD[n] += iMu[m]*cArg + rMu[m]*sArg;
10    }
11  }
```

#### Loop fission on the FᴴD computation.

```cpp
01  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
02    rMu[m] = rPhi[m]*rD[m] + iPhi[m]*iD[m];
03    iMu[m] = rPhi[m]*iD[m] - iPhi[m]*rD[m];
04  }
05  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
06    for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
07      float expFhD = 2*PI*(kx[m]*x[n] + ky[m]*y[n] + kz[m]*z[n]);
08      float cArg = cos(expFhD);
09      float sArg = sin(expFhD);
10      rFhD[n] += rMu[m]*cArg - iMu[m]*sArg;
11      iFhD[n] += iMu[m]*cArg + rMu[m]*sArg;
12    }
13  }
```

**a. List the execution order of these parts from different iterations of the outer loop before fission.**

In the original loop, for each iteration of the outer loop (`m` from `0` to `M-1`), the execution happens in the following order:
1. First part (statements before inner loop):
- Calculate `rMu[m]` (line `02`)
- Calculate `iMu[m]` (line `03`)

2. Second part (inner loop):
- For each n from 0 to N-1:
    - Calculate expFhD (line 05)
    - Calculate cArg (line 06)
    - Calculate sArg (line 07)
    - Update rFhD[n] (line 08)
    - Update iFhD[n] (line 09)

The execution order is as follows:
a. `m=0`
- First part (m = 0): lines 02-03
- Second part (m = 0): inner loop lines 05-09 for all n (0 to N-1)

b. `m=1`
- First part (m = 1): lines 02-03
- Second part (m = 1): inner loop lines 05-09 for all n (0 to N-1)

c. `m=2`
- First part (`m = 2`): lines 02-03
- Second part (`m = 2`): inner loop lines 05-09 for all n (0 to N-1)

... and so on until `m = M -1`

**b. List the execution order of these parts from the two loops after fission.**

1. First loop (lines 01-04): All `rMu` and `iMu` calculations are completed first
- `m=0`: Calculate `rMu[0]` and `iMu[0]`
- `m=1`: Calculate `rMu[1]` and `iMu[1]`
- `m=2`: Calculate `rMu[2]` and `iMu[2]`

... and so on until `m=M-1`

2. Second loop (lines 05-13): All inner loop calculations are completed after all `rMu/iMu` values are available
- `m=0`: Run inner loop for all `n` values (using pre-calculated `rMu[0]` and `iMu[0]`)
- `m=1`: Run inner loop for all `n` values (using pre-calculated `rMu[1]` and `iMu[1]`)
- `m=2`: Run inner loop for all `n` values (using pre-calculated `rMu[2]` and `iMu[2]`)

...and so on until m=M-1

Overall, the big change is that all of the `rMu/iMu` values are already pre-computed when we execute the inner loop. 

**c. Determine whether the execution results in parts (a) and (b) of this exercise will be identical. The execution results are identical if all data required by a part are properly generated and preserved for its consumption before that part executes and the execution result of the part is not overwritten by other parts that should come after the part in the original execution order.**

To answer this question, we need to analyze two aspects: 
1. Are all data required by the inner loop properly generated and preserved before the inner loop execution starts?
2. Are the results of the inner loop not overwritten in the inner loop? 

Let's try to answer this:
- 1: To calculate the second part of the fission code (lines `05-12`), we require the values of `rMu[m]` and `iMu[m]` to be already pre-calculated. This happens in the first part of the fission code (lines `01-04`). So the first **requirement is satisfied**.
- 2: We don't overwrite values for `rMu` and `iMu anywhere. The only override is `(+=)` on `rFhD[n]` and `iFhD[n]` in lines `10-11` and it happens in exactly the same order as in the original code, so **this requirement is satisfied as well.**

Hence, we can determine that yes, the result of `a and b part of this exericse will be identical`.

### Exercise 2

**Loop interchange swaps the inner loop into the outer loop and vice versa. Use the loops from Fig. 17.9 and enumerate the execution order of the instances of loop body before and after the loop exchange.**

```cpp
01  for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
02    for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
03      float expFhD = 2*PI*(kx[m]*x[n] + ky[m]*y[n] + kz[m]*z[n]);
04      float cArg = cos(expFhD);
05      float sArg = sin(expFhD);
06      rFhD[n] += rMu[m]*cArg - iMu[m]*sArg;
07      iFhD[n] += iMu[m]*cArg + rMu[m]*sArg;
08    }
09  }
```
Loop interchange of the FᴴD computation.

**a. List the execution order of the loop body from different iterations before loop interchange. Identify these iterations with the values of m and n.** 

```cpp
for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
  for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
    // Loop body
  }
}
```

- (n=0, m=0)
- (n=0, m=1)
- (n=0, m=2)
- ...
- (n=0, m=M-1)
- (n=1, m=0)
- (n=1, m=1)
- ...

We execute all iterations for `m` (from `0` to `M-1`) while keeping `n=0`, then increment `n` and repeat all iterations of `m` again. The total number of iterations is still `M×N`, namely the m-loop completes `N` times.

**b. List the execution order of the loop body from different iterations after loop interchange. Identify these iterations with the values of m and n.**

```cpp
for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
  for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
    // Loop body
  }
}
```

- (m=0, n=0)
- (m=0, n=1)
- (m=0, n=2)
- ...
- (m=0, n=N-1)
- (m=1, n=0)
- (m=1, n=1)
- ...

The pattern here is that we first execute all iterations for `n` (from `0` to `N-1`) while keeping `m=0`, then increment `m` and repeat all iterations of `n` again. The total number of iterations is `M×N`, with the n-loop completing `M` times.


**c. Determine whether the execution results in parts (a) and (b) of this exercise will be identical. The execution results are identical if all data required by a part are properly generated and preserved for its consumption before that part executes and the execution result of the part is not overwritten by other parts that should come after the part in the original execution order.**

To answer this question, we need to analyze two aspects: 
1. Are all data in both cases properly generated and preserved before the inner loop execution starts?
2. Are the results of the inner loop not overwritten in the inner loop?

1. The variables `expFhD`, `cArg`, and `sArg` are local to each iteration and don't carry values between iterations, so we can assume the first criterion is satisfied. 

2. The key operations affecting program state are: 

```cpp
rFhD[n] += rMu[m]*cArg - iMu[m]*sArg;
iFhD[n] += iMu[m]*cArg + rMu[m]*sArg;
```
These operations accumulate values into `rFhD[n]` and `iFhD[n]` using `+=`. Since addition is commutative and associative, the order in which we accumulate these values doesn't change the final result. In both loop orders, each `rFhD[n]` and `iFhD[n]` gets exactly the same set of updates from all values of `m`.

**Therefore, the execution results in parts (a) and (b) will be identical.** The loop interchange preserves the computation's correctness because there are no dependencies between different iterations that would be violated by changing the loop order.


### Exercise 3

**In Fig. 17.11, identify the difference between the access to x[] and kx[] in the nature of indices used. Use the difference to explain why it does not make sense to try to load kx[n] into a register for the kernel shown in Fig. 17.11**

```cpp
01  #define FHD_THREADS_PER_BLOCK 1024
02  __global__ void cmpFhD(float* rPhi, iPhi, phiMag,
                         kx, ky, kz, x, y, z, rMu, iMu, int M) {
03    int n = blockIdx.x * FHD_THREADS_PER_BLOCK + threadIdx.x;
                  // assign frequently accessed coordinate and output
                  // elements into registers
04    float xn_r = x[n]; float yn_r = y[n]; float zn_r = z[n];
05    float rFhDn_r = rFhD[n]; float iFhDn_r = iFhD[n];
06    for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
07      float expFhD = 2*PI*(kx[m]*xn_r+ky[m]*yn_r+kz[m]*zn_r);
08      float cArg = cos(expFhD);
09      float sArg = sin(expFhD);
10      rFhDn_r += rMu[m]*cArg - iMu[m]*sArg;
11      iFhDn_r += iMu[m]*cArg + rMu[m]*sArg;
12    }
13    rFhD[n] = rFhD_r; iFhD[n] = iFhD_r;
14  }
```

The access pattern for arrays uses different index variables:
- `x[]`, `y[]`, and `z[]` are accessed using index `n` (e.g., `x[n]`, `y[n]`, `z[n]`)
- `kx[]`, `ky[]`, and `kz[]` are accessed using index `m` (e.g., `kx[m]`, `ky[m]`, `kz[m]`)

This difference in indexing patterns is significant because:

1. The variable `n` is calculated once per thread and remains constant throughout the kernel execution for that thread (line 03): 
   ```cpp
   int n = blockIdx.x * FHD_THREADS_PER_BLOCK + threadIdx.x;
   ```

2. The variable `m` is used as a loop counter (line 06):
   ```cpp
   for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
   ```

It doesn't make sense to load `kx[n]` into a register because the kernel never uses `kx[n]` - it only ever accesses `kx[m]` where `m` iterates from 0 to M-1. 

Assuming that the question is wrong and they mean "it does not make sense to try to load *kx[m]*" the answer is that we access `M` values of `kx[m]`, for every one of `N/FHD_THREADS_PER_BLOCK` threads we are executing; it is not a value that could be shared across the loop.
