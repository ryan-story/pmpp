## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Complete the host code for configuring the grid and calling the kernel in Fig. 18.6 with all the execution configuration parameters.**

### Exercise 2

**Compare the number of operations (memory loads, floating-point arithmetic, branches) executed in each iteration of the kernel in Fig. 18.8 with that in Fig. 18.6 for a coarsening factor of 8. Keep in mind that each iteration of the former corresponds to eight iterations of the latter.**

### Exercise 3

**Give two potential disadvantages associated with increasing the amount of work done in each CUDA thread, as shown in Section 18.3.**

### Exercise 4

**Use Fig. 18.13 to explain how control divergence can arise when threads in a block process a bin in the neighborhood list.**
