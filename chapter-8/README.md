## Exercises

### Exercise 1
**Consider a 3D stencil computation on a grid of size 120 3 120 3 120, including boundary cells.**

**a. What is the number of output grid points that is computed during each stencil sweep?**

**b. For the basic kernel in Fig. 8.6, what is the number of thread blocks that are needed, assuming a block size of `8 3 8 3 8`? 188 CHAPTER 8 Stencil**

**c. For the kernel with shared memory tiling in Fig. 8.8, what is the number of thread blocks that are needed, assuming a block size of `8 3 8 3 8`?**

**d. For the kernel with shared memory tiling and thread coarsening in Fig. 8.10, what is the number of thread blocks that are needed, assuming a block size of `32 3 32` ?**


### Exercise 2

**Consider an implementation of a seven-point (3D) stencil with shared memory tiling and thread coarsening applied. The implementation is similar to those in Figs. 8.10 and 8.12, except that the tiles are not perfect cubes. Instead, a thread block size of 32 3 32 is used as well as a coarsening factor of 16 (i.e., each thread block processes 16 consecutive output planes in the z dimension).**

**a. What is the size of the input tile (in number of elements) that the thread block loads throughout its lifetime?**

**b. What is the size of the output tile (in number of elements) that the thread block processes throughout its lifetime?**

**c. What is the floating point to global memory access ratio (in OP/B) of the kernel?**

**d. How much shared memory (in bytes) is needed by each thread block if register tiling is not used, as in Fig. 8.10?**

**e. How much shared memory (in bytes) is needed by each thread block if register tiling is used, as in Fig. 8.12?**
